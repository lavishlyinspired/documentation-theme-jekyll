## Introduction

let us begin with the most basic example. It is fine if you do not understand everything right now, we will go into more detail later.

### A Simple Smart Contract

<pre>
---
pragma solidity ^0.4.0;



contract SimpleStorage {

    uint storedData;



    function set(uint x) public {

        storedData = x;

    }



    function get() public constant returns (uint) {

        return storedData;

    }

}
---
</pre>

### 1. Download the theme

First download or clone the theme from the [Github repo](https://github.com/tomjoht/documentation-theme-jekyll). Most likely you won't be pulling in updates once you start customizing the theme, so downloading the theme (instead of cloning it) probably makes the most sense. In Github, click the **Clone or download** button, and then click **Download ZIP**.

### 2. Install Jekyll

If you've never installed or run a Jekyll site locally on your computer, follow these instructions to install Jekyll:

* [Install Jekyll on Mac][mydoc_install_jekyll_on_mac]
* [Install Jekyll on Windows][mydoc_install_jekyll_on_windows]

### 3. Install Bundler

In case you haven't installed Bundler, install it:

```
gem install bundler
```

You'll want [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) to make sure all the Ruby gems needed work well with your project. Bundler sorts out dependencies and installs missing gems or matches up gems with the right versions based on gem dependencies.

### 4. Option 1: Build the Theme (*without* the github-pages gem) {#option1}

Use this option if you're not planning to publish your Jekyll site using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Bundler's Gemfile is how it specifies and manages project dependencies are managed. Although this project includes a Gemfile, this theme doesn't have any dependencies beyond core Jekyll. The Gemfile is used to specify gems needed for publishing on Github Pages. **If you're not planning to have Github Pages build your Jekyll project, delete these two files from the theme's root directory:**

* Gemfile
* Gemfile.lock

If you've never run Jekyll on your computer (you can check with `jekyll --version`), you may need to install the jekyll gem:

```
gem install jekyll
```

Now run jekyll serve (first change directories (`cd`) to where you downloaded the project):

```
jekyll serve
```

### 4. Option 2: Build the Theme (*with* the github-pages gem) {#option2}

If you *are* in fact publishing on Github Pages, leave the Gemfile and Gemfile.lock files in the theme.The Gemfile tells Jekyll to use the github-pages gem. **However, note that you cannot use the normal `jekyll serve` command with this gem due to dependency conflicts between the latest version of Jekyll and Github Pages** (which are noted [briefly here](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/)).

You need Bundler to resolve these dependency conflicts. Use Bundler to install all the needed Ruby gems:

```
bundle update
```

Then *always* use this command to build Jekyll:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

If you want to shorten this long command, you can put this code in a file such as jekyll.sh (on a Mac) and then simply type `. jekyll.sh` to build Jekyll.


<pre>
---
pragma solidity ^0.4.0;



contract SimpleStorage {

    uint storedData;



    function set(uint x) public {

        storedData = x;

    }



    function get() public constant returns (uint) {

        return storedData;

    }

}

</pre>
{% include note.html content="If you have just one character of spacing off, Jekyll won't build due to the YAML syntax error. You'll see an error message in your console that says \"Error ... did not find expected key while parsing a block mapping at line 22 column 5. Error: Run jekyll build --trace for more information.\" If you encounter this, it usually refers to incorrect indentation or spacing in the YAML file. See the example mydoc_sidebar.yml file to see where your formatting went wrong." %}

## Running the site in Docker

You can also use Docker to directly build and run the site on your local machine. Just clone the repo and run the following from your working dir:
```
docker-compose build --no-cache && docker-compose up
```
The site should now be running at [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/).

This is perhaps the easiest way to see how your site would actually look.

## Configure the sidebar

There are several products in this theme. Each product uses a different sidebar. This is the essence of what makes this theme unique -- different sidebars for different product documentation. The idea is that when users are reading documentation for a specific product, the sidebar navigation should be specific to that product. (You can read more of my thoughts on why multiple sidebars are important in this [blog post](http://idratherbewriting.com/2016/03/23/release-of-documentation-theme-for-jekyll-50/).)

The top navigation usually remains the same, because it allows users to navigate across products. But the sidebar navigation adapts to the product.

In each page's frontmatter, you must specify the sidebar you want that page to use. Here's an example of the page frontmatter showing the sidebar property:

<pre>
---
title: Alerts
tags: [formatting]
keywords: notes, tips, cautions, warnings, admonitions
last_updated: July 3, 2016
summary: "You can insert notes, tips, warnings, and important alerts in your content. These notes are stored as shortcodes made available through the linksrefs.hmtl include."
<span class="red">sidebar: mydoc_sidebar</span>
permalink: mydoc_alerts
---
</pre>

The `sidebar: mydoc_sidebar` refers to the \_data/sidebars/mydoc_sidebar.yml file.

Note that your sidebar can only have 2 levels (expand the **Tag archives** option to see an example of the second level). Given that each product has its own sidebar, this depth should be sufficient (it's really like 3 levels). Deeper nesting goes against usability recommendations.

You can optionally turn off the sidebar on any page (e.g. landing pages). To turn off the sidebar for a page, you should set the page frontmatter tag as `hide_sidebar: true`.

If you don't declare a sidebar, the `home_sidebar` file gets used as the default because this is the default specified in the config file:

```yaml
-
  scope:
    path: ""
    type: "pages"
  values:
    layout: "page"
    comments: true
    search: true
    sidebar: home_sidebar
    topnav: topnav
```

If you want to set different sidebar defaults based on different folders for your pages, specify your defaults like this:

```
-
  scope:
    path: "pages/mydoc"
    type: "pages"
  values:
    layout: "page"
    comments: true
    search: true
    sidebar: mydoc_sidebar
    topnav: topnav
```

This would load the `mydoc_sidebar` for each file in **pages/mydoc**. You could set different defaults for different path scopes.

For more detail on the sidebar, see [Sidebar navigation][mydoc_sidebar_navigation].

```js
console.log('hello');
